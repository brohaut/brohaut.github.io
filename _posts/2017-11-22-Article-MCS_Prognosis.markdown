Our paper entitled **"Survival and consciousness recovery are better in the minimally conscious state than in the vegetative state"** showing how much it is important to detect Minimally Conscious State (MCS) even early after a brain injury (here <90 days in the ICU) is available online on [*Brain Injury*](http://www.tandfonline.com.gate2.inist.fr/doi/full/10.1080/02699052.2017.1364421).  


Survival and, more importantly, **recovery of consciousness with at least a partial autonomy** (GOSE>3) were more frequent if a patient was diagnosed MCS (47%, in comparison to only 3% for patients in a Vegetative State); see figure below).

***Functional outcome in patients in the vegetative (VS/UWS) and the minimally conscious state (MCS).***   
Histograms of vegetative state (aka Unresponsive Wakefulenss Syndrome - VS/UWS) and MCS outcomes evaluated with the [GOSE scale]({{ site.url }}/2017/Post_GOS-E/).
Delay from acute brain injury and outcome was ~16 months.  
GOSE = 4 corresponds to a patient with a severe disability but conscious and who can be left at least 8h during the day without assistance.
