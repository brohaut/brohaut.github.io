Jennett and Bond proposed the first version of the Glasgow Outcome Scale in 1975, defining 5 categories of possible outcomes after a brain injury (1):  

### **Glasgow Outcome Scale GOS**

| Category number     |  Name           | Definition  |
| :------|:-------------| :-----|
| 5 | **Good recovery**  | resumption of normal life (minor neurological or psychological deficits)|
| 4 | **Moderate disability**   | disabled but independent for daily life; work capacity is reduced|
| 3 | **Sever disability**  | conscious but dependent for daily life; unable to travel or go shopping without assistance|
| 2 | **Persistent vegetative state** | unresponsive and speechless   |
| 1 | **Death**  |    |

In most of the publications, authors refer to a number instead of the name of a given category (e.g. "GOS 3" instead of "Sever disability"). However, because **the order of these categories varies across studies**, the reader should be very cautious when interpreting these numbers and always check carefully the used referential.  

In their first publication (1; but contrarily to the latter (2)), Jennett & Bond ordered the 5 categories that way.

Latter, the same authors proposed to split the 3 better categories (sever disability to good recovery or, 3 to 5 here) in **Lower & Upper sub-categories**, giving the extended version of the scale (the GOS-E) which include 6 + 2 (death and VS) = 8 categories (2).

### **Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended GOS-E**

| Category number**      |  Name           | Definition (see refs for more details)|
| :------------- |:-------------| :-----|
| 8 | **Good recovery** *Upper*   | no current problems related to the brain injury that affect daily life|
| 7 | **Good recovery** *lower*   | minor problems that affect daily life; resumes >50% of the pre-injury level of social and leisure activities|
| 6 | **Moderate disability**  *Upper* | reduced work capacity; resumes <50% of the pre-injury level of social and leisure activities|
| 5 | **Moderate disability** *Lower*| unable to work or only in sheltered workshop|
| 4 | **Sever disability** *Upper*  | can be left alone at > 8h during the day, but unable to travel and/or go shopping without assistance|
| 3 | **Sever disability** *Lower* | requires frequent help of someone to be around at home most of the time every day|
| 2 | **Persistent vegetative state** | unresponsive and speechless   |
| 1 | **Death**  |    |

** Here I voluntarily kept the same order as in the first table; note that most of recent publications use this order though, "the higher the number the better the outcome" but again, **the reader should always check carefully the used referential!**
