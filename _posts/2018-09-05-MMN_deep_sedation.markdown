Probing brain activity under **deep sedation**: Our paper entiteled *"Mismatch negativity to predict subsequent awakening in deeply sedated critically ill patients"* showing how event related potentials can help monitor **brain dysfunction** and predict further awakening of deeply sedated ICU patients is out on the [British Journal of Anaesthesia](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2018.06.029) website and as a postprint [here]({{ site.url }}/images//MMN_deep_sed/Azabou _Rohaut_BJA_2018_postprint.pdf).

***Grand average ERPs curves recorded on group healthy volunteers and in sedated critically ill patients:***   

![Figure]({{ site.url }}/images/MMN_deep_sed/Figure.png)

The figure shows the grand average ERPs curves recorded at Cz and Fz scalp positions from the group of 9 non-sedated healthy volunteers in our laboratory (A), the 43 deeply sedated critically ill patients (B), the subgroup of 13 deeply sedated critically patients who did not awake (C) and the subgroup of 30 deeply sedated patients who awoke (D), using the same recording paradigm. Blue areas show significant differences (paired t-test p-values <.05 for a duration ≥ 10ms).
