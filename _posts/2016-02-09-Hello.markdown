I am a French neuro-intensivist & neuroscientist (Md, PhD).
My research aims to better understand brain dysfunctions in ICU patients and to develop new tools to probe residual cognitive abilities in patients suffering from disorder of consciousness (DOC) in order to improve diagnosis and prognosis.
